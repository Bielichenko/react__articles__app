# React__articles__app
Hi! This is my test task.

DEMO LINK: https://bielichenko.github.io/react__articles__app/

## Task description
You need to build Single Page Application with React.
Use any open API to get article names and descriptions.
Home page should contain:
1. Cards with article titles and descriptions for 100 characters. The user can click on the card to go to an article page that contains the title and full description of the selected article.
2. A field to filter by keyword. The user enters keywords into the field and the system displays all articles containing at least one of the keywords in the name or/and description.
The priority of fields: (1) names; and (2) description. The article with one match in the name is higher than the article with one match in the description.
The matched keywords should be highlighted with yellow color.
